** Crudely calculate MtDM/yr demand for 2020-2050 from Galina et al 2020
** After harvest lÃ¶ss accounting, buildings will create an additiona demand
** of
** BAU 0.002867864
** 10pc 0.057357277
** 50pc 0.286786385
** 90pc 0.516215493
** in GtC/yr. (See fig.4 and SI table 10 col 8 (or4?))
** GtC is converted to MtDM by multiplying with 2 (C to DM) and 1000 (Gt to Mt)
** These values can be added to already calculated wood demand
** for 2050-2100 time, we can keep this demand 1.5 times higher
