*' @title Forestry
*'
*' @description The Forestry module describes the constraints under which managed
*' forest (age-class forest) exists. At the same time it calculates the corresponding
*' carbon stocks. This module provides the total carbon dioxide removal from afforestation
*' to the Green House Gases policy module ([56_ghg-policy]), aggregated difference in
*' forestry land compared to previous timestep to the land module ([10_land]) and also
*' provides the forestry related costs to the costs module ([11_costs]) while accounting
*' for drivers in the form of timber demand ([16-demand]), carbon stock and carbon density
*' ([52_carbon]) and land use levels (i.e., initialization and land use patterns) ([10_land]).
