Description: The Model of Agricultural Production and its Impact on the
    Environment (MAgPIE) is a modular open source framework for modeling
    global land-systems, which is coupled to the grid-based dynamic
    vegetation model LPJmL, with a spatial resolution of 0.5°x0.5°. It
    takes regional economic conditions such as demand for agricultural
    commodities, technological development and production costs as well as
    spatially explicit data on potential crop yields, land and water
    constraints (from LPJmL) into account. Based on these, the model
    derives specific land use patterns, yields and total costs of
    agricultural production for each grid cell. The objective function of
    the land use model is to minimize total cost of production for a given
    amount of regional food and bioenergy demand. Regional food energy
    demand is defined for an exogenously given population in 10 food
    energy categories, based on regional diets. Future trends in food
    demand are derived from a cross-country regression analysis, based on
    future scenarios on GDP and population growth.
